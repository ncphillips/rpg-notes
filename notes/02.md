# Session 2

## Enter, Raume

There's a knock on the door. 

It's Raume.

### Who are these men? Why are you looking for them?

They arrived at Home 3 weeks ago asking if they could join our community.
They merely wanted to take advantage. They ate and drank egregiously, 
and forced themselves on women. They had been warned, but two nights ago 
they murdered a girl. When we found them they had already fled. I have
been tracking them ever since.
