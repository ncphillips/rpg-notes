# Yabba (Alex)

A female Tabaxi (cat-folk) trained as a Kensei Monk and an avid knitter.

She was born into the Caravan of Nomadic Monks, but was outcast
by the monk group for unseemly behaviour.

Carries most of her stuff herself, but tries to pawn off carrying
stuff to the others. Almost seeis the other party members as her assistents.

Yabba feels more comfortable travelling with a Caravan and was
happy to have some new people join them. In return she is capable
of returning clothing; connections with merchant guilds.

She has started a rumour about herself that she pinned a thief to a wall
with her knitting needles.

At heart, Yabba is a merchant.

## Trinket

She owns a one oune block made from an unknown material.

## Bulezau Skull

She took this skull after they defeated the demon.
