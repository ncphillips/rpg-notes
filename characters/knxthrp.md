## Knxthrp (Tim)

A Dragon Born Warlock of the Pact of the Blade.

His patron is a fiend–this is the being from which he derives his power.

He was attracted to the Pact of the Blade because it seemed like the strongest.
He is willing to eschew morality. He thinks it's hokey and stupid and thinks the
only way to be successful is to become poweful.

He has a weird sense of devoition to his clan, despite being
individualistic, not afraid to get his hands dirty.

Dragonborn are uncommon in these lands. He set off because he didn't
like living in one place, or the ritual and formality of living in
a dragonborn society.

> Bodyguard would be a generous description of my past employment.

## Relationships

### Yabba

Knxthrp is a knitter, but is too afraid to admit it, because
he is embaraced that he's not as good as Yabba. They shit talk.

### Badger

Knxthrp finds Badger to be bizar but useful. He seems to understand the way to get
by in this world. At a fundamental level, they get each other. Knxthrp is more
direct, and doesn't quite understand the whole illusion thing.
