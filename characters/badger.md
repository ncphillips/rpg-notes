# Badger (Chris)

Roondar "Badger" Nackle is a 80-year young Gnome Warlock who derives his
power from _the Arch Faye_.

Pact of the chain.

Left his hometown of _Stumble Duck_ after his encouter with the
Arch Faye. Thought he might make more of himself by learning magic
beyond the simple spells tinkered with there.

His familiar is a sprite, an envoy from the Arch Faye who has followed
him since he left the bog.

Badger is focussed mostly on illusiary magic, and seeks to learn it's mysteries.

Makes some slightly magical artifacts and trinkets that Yabba weaves into garments.

He has a small weightless stone block
