# The Gardener

The Gardener is the Firbolg leader of the hamlet known as Home.
He started this town with the purpose of bringing together people
of all races and backgrounds so as to live harmoniously. While
living in Dunsgatha, he established himself an happy, intelligent,
and charismatic. He used these skills to push his way into
business and politics, where he exceled. One day he disapeared.
He returned several months later in secret. He invited former
followers to his new home, where he had planned to build a new
city.

As a Firbolg, he does not have a name. While in Dunsgatha he was
simply known as "Firbolg". He has adopted the name "The Gardener"
as a reference to the way in which he intends to lead the city.
