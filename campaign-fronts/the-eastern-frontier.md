## Dangers

### Home (Ambitious Organization)

Home is a fledgling town of about 40 adults and 15 children.
Although a small town, they have attracted some incredibly 
intelligent people, and are actively looking to grow.

**Impulse:** To spread their tollerance and wealth. (Misguided Good)

**Moves**

* Attack someone by stealthy means (kidnapping, etc.)

* Establish a new rule (within the organization)
* Claim territory or resources
* Negotiate a deal

### The Source (Cursed Place)

The source of the river that flows to Home.

There is a cave that river water comes from. A small lake
sits at the cavern's entrance, and a strangely horrid
cold smell is drawn out with the gushing water. Some 
distance inside the cave is an enormous drop. There is a 
waterfall, but it falls up. The water rushes up from deep 
inside the ground and over the edge into a pool, where 
it then flows out into the lake.

**Impulse:** to corrupt and consume the living (shadow land)

**Grim Portents**
