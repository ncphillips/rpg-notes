# Factions 

## The Caravan of Nomadic Monks

This is Yabba's original faction. They are fairly well off, and have
strong ties to the guilds of various cities.




## The Carpenters Guild

* The numbers in this guild are dwindling.
* They have not had a profitable year for almost a decade.




## The Stonemasons Guild

* In recent years they have bought much political favour, and have 
  basically shoved the Carpenters Guild out of any serious building
  opereations.
