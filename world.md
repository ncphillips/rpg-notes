year ago he went missing and was presumed to be dead. In reality,
he left the city to join The Gardener in his new home.

### Gilda (Revenant)

Gilda was Raume's wife. A couple months ago her husband disapeared,
he returned and asker her to come with him to Home. She agreed,
but after several months she could not handle it anymore. As a
woman of fair tastes, she did not get used to the hard life in 
a frontier town. She sent a letter to her lover Dunsgatha, who she
had been seeing since her husbands apparent death. She told him 
that Raume had gone mad and begged him to come fetch her. They had 
planned to travel north to Nesh, but the were tracked and then 
killed by Raume and another man from Home. Raume knew the child was
too young to be his own, so he let the baby die as well.
